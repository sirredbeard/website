The Nim team is happy to announce version 1.0.4, our second patch release following
Nim 1.0.0.

To read more about version 1.0.0, take a look at our
[release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2019/09/23/version-100-released.html)
from two months ago.

Although this release comes only one month after a previous release,
it has over [70 new commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.4),
fixing another 20 reported issues, making our 1.0 release even better.
