Mark the date: Saturday, June 20th 2020.

As the COVID-19 situation unfolds, many of us are stuck at home.
This gives us a perfect reason to set up an online conference and we are doing
just that.
NimConf 2020 will take place in about a month from now -- on **June 20th**.
It will be streamed for free and it doesn't require any travelling - you will be
able to participate from your home, without any travel and accommodation expenses.


## Open registration

If you have created something interesting (a library, CLI, game, web app, GUI, etc.)
using Nim and would like to present it to the world, this is a great opportunity
to do it.

Your talk can take anywhere between 15 and 60 minutes.

All you need to do is to come up with the title of your talk and [fill the
registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLeVBRETQW-iHiegW7xs52AKYH0g3xoxM7xPdtgTjPBs9Txg/viewform)
before the **deadline -- May 31st**.

If you wish to give multiple talks, all you have to do is fill the form once for
each talk.


## Participating as an audience

All talks will be streamed and recorded for later viewing.
Watching the talks live will allow you to ask questions and participate in the
discussions.

The timeline of talks will be published after the submissions deadline.
