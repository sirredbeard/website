The Nim team is happy to announce version 1.0.2, our first patch release following
Nim 1.0.0.

To read more about version 1.0.0, take a look at our
[release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2019/09/23/version-100-released.html)
from just a month ago.

Although this release comes only one month after a previous release,
it has over [60 new commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.2),
fixing over 40 reported issues, making our 1.0 release even better.

## Installing 1.0.2

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using ``choosenim``,
getting Nim 1.0.2 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can get ``choosenim`` by following
[these instructions](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) or you can install
Nim by following the instructions on our
